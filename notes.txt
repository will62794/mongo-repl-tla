[X] Add a notion of entries being "committed at a term t". For example, for prefix committed entries, the
term of the entry itself may be different from the term at which it is committed. The "commitment term" is
what's important for the Leader Completeness Property. That is, an entry committed at term t is guaranteed
to appear in the logs of all future leaders with terms > t. It does not mean that all leaders with terms greater
than the _term of the committed entry_ necessarily contain the entry.

[ ] Add proper type invariants

[ ] Add a StateMachineSafety correctness property

[ ] Can GetEntries just retrieve entries from ANY log in 'allLogs'? This would be a very generalized
form of log retrieval i.e. saying that a node can get entries from any state in the past as long as
Log Matching is upheld.
